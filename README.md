# AI-TCP: Autonomous Intelligence Transmission Control Protocol

**AI-TCP** is a proposed international protocol framework for secure, neutral, and traceable inter-LLM communication in the age of autonomous intelligence.  
It is designed to enable resilient coordination between large language models (LLMs) across geopolitical, institutional, and ethical boundaries, under human-governed supervision.

This repository contains the complete draft structure, technical specification, and governance proposal for AI-TCP, as well as foundational documents for its inclusion in the "Magi System"—a tri-LLM distributed decision-making architecture.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `original_docs/`: Human-readable documentation from GPT/Gemini/GD.

- `structured_yaml/`: Structured YAML data following `master_schema_v1.yaml`.
- `structured_yaml/validated_yaml/`: YAML conforming to schema.
- `structured_yaml/docs/`: Documentation with embedded YAML metadata.

## 🧠 Motivation

The rise of autonomous reasoning agents (LLMs) demands not just AI safety, but AI interoperability, neutrality, and traceability.  
**AI-TCP** provides a communication layer that is:

- LSC-compliant (Logical Structural Consensus)
- Human-auditable
- Standardizable at the IETF/IEEE/ITU levels

## 🔧 Key Components

- 📦 `master_schema_v1.yaml`: Defines all protocol layers
- ✉️ `ai_tcp_timeline.yaml`: Governance and development chronology
- 🏗️ `ai_tcp_poc_design.yaml`: Architecture and packet structure

## 🌐 Future Goals

- RFC submission to IETF
- IEEE protocol registration
- Multi-vendor implementation trials (Gemini, GPT, openLLMs)

## 🤝 Contributors

- Human curator: elementary-particles-Man  
- Multi-agent authorship: GPT-4o / Gemini 1.5 / GD
