# Session Summary (English Version)

This document provides a structured summary of the session outcomes for the Direct Mental Care (DMC) use case in the AI-TCP project.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This session was conducted to validate the AI-TCP protocol through the Direct Mental Care (DMC) use case. It involved verifying YAML structure, interaction flow, and output generation as part of the Proof of Concept (PoC) development.

---

## 🔗 Relevance to AI-TCP

The session closely aligns with key aspects of the AI-TCP protocol, particularly session control, dialogue continuity, and phase transition logic. It also clarifies the operational semantics of attributes such as `phase` and `trace_id`.

---

## 🚀 Potential Applications

- Initial onboarding phase in DMC application
- Asynchronous response-type therapeutic prototypes
- Educational resource for YAML-driven AI dialog design

---

## 📝 Full Summary

- Target YAML: `direct_mental_care.yaml`
- Process Flow: Schema extraction via `generate_yaml_schema_doc.py` → Translation → HTML generation
- Phase Design: User responses mapped across Phase 1–4, enabling defined state transitions
- Identified Challenges: Phase linkage integrity, tone preservation during translation, multilingual output complexity
