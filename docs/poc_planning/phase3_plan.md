PoC Phase 3: Plan and Objectives
1. Primary Goal
To validate the model-agnostic interoperability of the AI-TCP protocol by testing it with external, third-party LLMs (e.g., Grok, Claude, other open-source models).
2. Key Tasks
Grok Reverse Reception Test (PoC #6):
Objective: Send a standardized AI-TCP packet (e.g., intent_001.yaml and its Mermaid graph) to a Grok endpoint.
Success Metric: Evaluate Grok's ability to generate a narrative or reconstructed YAML that aligns with the original intent, measured by the metrics in GG06_evaluation_metrics.md.
Codex Automation Suite (Tooling):
Objective: Develop a suite of Go-based tools for repository maintenance.
Tasks:
link_map_checker.go: Automatically verifies the integrity of link_map.json.
semantic_linter.go: Provides warnings for potential semantic inconsistencies between linked artifacts.
Round-Trip Transaction Test (PoC #7):
Objective: Simulate a full, bi-directional transaction between two different
