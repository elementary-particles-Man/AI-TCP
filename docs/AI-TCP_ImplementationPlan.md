# AI-TCP Rust Implementation Plan

This document outlines the architectural layers and a high-level roadmap for the canonical Rust implementation of the AI-TCP protocol.

## 1. Architectural Layers

The Rust implementation will adhere to a layered architecture to ensure modularity, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

### 1.1. Cryptographic Primitives Layer

*   **Purpose**: Provides low-level cryptographic operations (e.g., key generation, encryption/decryption, signing/verification).
*   **Components**: Utilizes `ed25519-dalek`, `chacha20poly1305`, `rand`, `hmac`, `sha2`.
*   **Key Modules**: `keygen.rs`, `signature.rs`, `compression.rs`.

### 1.2. FlatBuffers Serialization Layer

*   **Purpose**: Handles the serialization and deserialization of AI-TCP packet structures to and from byte buffers.
*   **Components**: Generated Rust code from FlatBuffers schemas (`ai_tcp_packet_generated.rs`, `ephemeral_session_generated.rs`).
*   **Key Modules**: `packet_parser.rs`.

### 1.3. Packet Processing Layer

*   **Purpose**: Manages the construction, validation, and interpretation of AI-TCP packets.
*   **Components**: `ai_tcp_packet_validator.rs`, `replay_attack_guard.rs`.

### 1.4. Session Management Layer

*   **Purpose**: Oversees the establishment, maintenance, and termination of secure communication sessions.
*   **Components**: `ephemeral_session_manager.rs`, `session_resumption.rs`, `ephemeral_resumption.rs`.

### 1.5. Network Abstraction Layer

*   **Purpose**: Provides an interface for sending and receiving raw byte streams over the underlying network (e.g., TCP/IP).
*   **Components**: Utilizes `tokio` for asynchronous I/O.

### 1.6. Application/API Layer

*   **Purpose**: Exposes the AI-TCP functionality to higher-level applications and services.
*   **Components**: `api_server` crate, `client_sdk`.

## 2. High-Level Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Protocol Implementation (Current Focus)

*   Complete and stabilize the `AITcpPacket` serialization/deserialization.
*   Implement robust cryptographic operations (key exchange, encryption, signing).
*   Develop basic session establishment and management.
*   Integrate `ai_tcp_packet_validator` and `replay_attack_guard`.
*   Establish a minimal working end-to-end communication flow.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features & Robustness

*   Implement full session resumption mechanisms.
*   Develop flow control and congestion control (e.g., `rate_control.rs`).
*   Enhance error handling and fault tolerance.
*   Optimize performance and resource utilization.
*   Expand `client_sdk` functionality.

### Phase 3: Network Integration & Deployment

*   Integrate with various network environments and transport protocols.
*   Develop comprehensive testing suites (unit, integration, performance).
*   Prepare for formal specification and standardization efforts.
*   Develop deployment and operational tooling.

## 3. Development Guidelines

*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Prioritize writing tests before or alongside implementation.
*   **Code Review**: All significant changes must undergo peer review.
*   **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date and clear documentation for all modules and APIs.
*   **Performance**: Continuously monitor and optimize for performance, especially in cryptographic and network-intensive parts.
*   **Security**: Adhere to best practices for secure coding and cryptographic implementation.
