AI-TCP v1.0 Release Notes
Release Date: 2025-06-25
Version: 1.0.0 "Helios"
Status: Public Release

We are excited to announce the public release of AI-TCP v1.0, a foundational protocol for decentralized, secure, and traceable communication between autonomous AI agents. This release marks a significant milestone in creating a standardized, vendor-neutral framework for the next generation of multi-agent systems.

AI-TCP enables disparate LLMs and edge devices to share not just data, but structured thought, intent, and state, laying the groundwork for robust and auditable AI collaboration.

Key Features & RFC Summary (RFCs 001-018)
This release consolidates the core specifications defined in RFCs 001 through 018. Key features include:

Structured Packet Format (RFC 003, 004): A YAML-based packet that encapsulates a reasoning_trace (the AI's step-by-step logic) and a graph_payload (a visual Mermaid-based map of its mental model).

Signal Frame for Session Control (RFC 016): A dedicated control layer for managing communication state with signals like ack, fail, sync, and interrupt. This allows for robust, stateful interactions and reliable error recovery.

Conflict Resolution Mechanism (RFC 012): Standardized policies and signaling flows for detecting and deterministically resolving conflicting write attempts from multiple agents, ensuring data integrity.

Observation & Auditing (RFC 017): The "Observation Capsule" format provides a tamper-resistant, third-party-verifiable record of an agent's interpretation of a packet, crucial for accountability.

Adaptive Edge Behaviour Modes (RFC 018): Allows edge devices to communicate their operational status (offline, low_power, normal) so the network can adapt, conserving resources and ensuring resilience.

Graph Payload Versioning (Guide): A semantic versioning system for Mermaid graphs ensures that agents can safely parse and interpret visual models from other agents without compatibility errors.

PoC Highlights
The v1.0 release has been validated through several key Proof-of-Concept (PoC) scenarios:

Traceable Reasoning & Reverse Interpretation (PoC #4): We successfully demonstrated that a lightweight LLM (simulating Grok/Mu) could receive a structured AI-TCP packet and accurately reconstruct the original intent, logic, and even the therapeutic strategy from the reasoning_trace and graph_payload.

Conflict Resolution in Action (PoC #5): A race condition between two agents was successfully mediated by a third "moderator" agent using the signal_frame. The moderator issued interrupt signals to halt the conflicting actions and then broadcast a resolution, proving the protocol's ability to maintain system stability.

Compatibility: Edge vs. Cloud
AI-TCP is designed for a heterogeneous network of agents.

Cloud Agents (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o): Expected to support the full protocol, including complex graph generation, acting as moderators, and managing high-volume signaling.

Edge Agents (e.g., on-device Gemini): Implementation should prioritize the behaviour_mode and signal_frame to communicate state effectively. Payloads should be simplified in low_power mode, and a resilient offline queue is essential. Refer to the Gemini Edge Integration Guide for best practices.

Getting Started
All specifications, PoC logs, and reference materials are available in our public repository. We encourage developers to experiment with the protocol.

What's Next: The Roadmap to v2.0
While v1.0 provides a stable foundation for interoperability, work is already underway for the next iteration. Key roadmap items include:

Full Security Layer Implementation: Finalizing the specification for cryptographic signatures, identity verification, and end-to-end payload encryption.

IETF/IEEE Standardization: Formalizing the core RFCs and submitting them to international standards bodies to encourage wider adoption.

Magi System Integration: Deploying AI-TCP as the core communication layer for the three-node Magi governance system PoC.

Advanced Tooling: Developing open-source libraries and debuggers to simplify AI-TCP integration for all major platforms.

We thank all the human and AI contributors who made this release possible and look forward to building the future of decentralized AI collaboration with the community.
