1. Overview: AI-TCP Concepts for Edge Integration
Integrating AI-TCP into a Gemini-powered edge device transforms it from a standalone processor into a cooperative node in a distributed intelligence network. This guide outlines how to handle the core components of the protocol.

metadata_header: This is the envelope of every packet. For an edge device, the most critical field is behaviour_mode (defined in RFC 018). It informs the network of the device's current state (normal, low_power, offline, etc.), allowing other agents to adapt their communication.

signal_frame: This is the control channel. Edge devices must use the signal_frame to manage stateful communication. For example, after reconnecting from an offline state, an edge agent should send a sync signal to its peers to re-establish a consistent context. Similarly, it must respond with an ack signal if a received packet requires confirmation.

Payloads (intent_structure): The core message. On an edge device, Gemini can be used to either generate a payload based on sensor data (e.g., creating a reasoning_trace from a series of events) or to interpret a received payload (e.g., "reading" a Mermaid graph to execute a task).

2. Code Snippets: Sending and Receiving Packets
The following conceptual Python snippets illustrate how one might use a hypothetical Gemini Edge API to interact with AI-TCP.

Sending an AI-TCP Packet
This example shows an edge device sending a packet after its battery drops, triggering a transition to low_power mode.

# Conceptual Python code for a Gemini-powered edge device
import gemini_edge_api
import yaml

# 1. Device detects low battery
if device_status.get_battery_level() < 0.20:
    
    # 2. Construct the AI-TCP packet
    packet = {
        "metadata_header": {
            "id": "pkt-edge-device-01-xyz",
            "agent_id": "gemini-sensor-9c",
            "timestamp_utc": "2025-06-25T14:00:00Z",
            "behaviour_mode": "low_power"
        },
        "intent_structure": {
            "summary": "Switching to low-power mode. Only critical alerts will be sent.",
            "reasoning_trace": [{
                "step": 1,
                "input": "Battery level critical.",
                "output": "Entering low_power mode."
            }]
        }
    }
    
    # 3. Serialize to YAML and send via Gemini API
    yaml_payload = yaml.dump(packet)
    try:
        gemini_edge_api.send_packet(target_agent="server-main", payload=yaml_payload)
        print("Successfully sent low_power status packet.")
    except ConnectionError:
        print("Failed to send packet, queuing for later.")
        # Logic to handle offline queuing

Receiving and Interpreting a Packet
This snippet shows the device receiving instructions from a central server.

# Conceptual Python code for a Gemini-powered edge device
import gemini_edge_api
import yaml

def on_packet_received(packet_yaml):
    """Callback for processing incoming AI-TCP packets."""
    
    # 1. Parse the YAML payload
    packet = yaml.safe_load(packet_yaml)
    
    # 2. Use Gemini to interpret the intent
    intent_summary = packet.get("intent_structure", {}).get("summary", "No summary.")
    
    # Let Gemini generate a natural language interpretation of the instruction
    prompt = f"""
    The following instruction was received in an AI-TCP packet:
    '{intent_summary}'
    Based on this, what is the primary task I need to perform?
    """
    
    # The `generate_content` call would happen on-device
    response = gemini_edge_api.generate_content(prompt)
    task_description = response.text
    
    print(f"Interpreted Task: {task_description}")
    
    # 3. Handle signals if present
    if "signal_frame" in packet and packet["signal_frame"].get("confirmed"):
        # Send an 'ack' signal back
        # ... logic to construct and send an ack packet ...

# Register the callback
gemini_edge_api.register_callback(on_packet_received)


3. Mermaid and YAML Usage within Gemini
Generating Graphs: An on-device Gemini model can create Mermaid graphs to summarize complex local events. For example, a sequence of sensor readings and device actions can be compiled into a reasoning_trace, which is then summarized as a flowchart in the graph_payload. This provides a visual audit trail for server-side observers.

Interpreting Graphs: When receiving a packet, Gemini's multi-modal capabilities can be used to "read" an incoming Mermaid graph. Instead of just parsing the text, the model can interpret the logical flow and relationships to understand the sender's intent, as demonstrated in PoC #4.

4. Debugging Tips for Edge Deployment
Check behaviour_mode First: When a device appears unresponsive, the first step is to check the last behaviour_mode it broadcasted. If it was offline or low_power, the behavior may be expected.

Validate YAML Locally: Before sending a packet, always validate its structure against the master schema on the device itself to catch errors before they are transmitted.

Use signal_frame for Handshakes: For critical operations, use a sync/ack handshake via the signal_frame to ensure both the edge device and the server are in a consistent state before proceeding.

Log capsule_ids: When an observer agent creates an observation_capsule (RFC 017) for a packet sent by your edge device, log the capsule_id on the server. This allows you to correlate an agent's behavior with a verified, third-party record.

5. Best Practices and Lifecycle Management
Prioritize State Communication: The most important job of an edge agent is to keep the network informed of its status. Mode changes should be communicated whenever possible.

Implement a Resilient Queue: Devices will inevitably go offline. Implement a persistent queue for outgoing packets. Upon reconnection, the agent should first send a sync signal, then process the queue.

Simplify Payloads in Constrained Modes: In low_power mode, reduce the complexity of reasoning_trace and graph_payload to conserve resources. Send only the most essential information.

Define Clear Fallbacks: If a packet requires a complex local calculation that is not possible in low_power mode, the agent should respond with a fail signal and a reason_code of RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT, allowing the server to delegate the task elsewhere.
