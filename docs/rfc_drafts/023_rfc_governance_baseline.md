# RFC Governance Baseline for AI-TCP

This document defines the foundational governance principles for the AI-TCP protocol. It establishes the operating norms for evolving, managing, and maintaining the protocol and its reference implementations.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Principles

1. **Protocol Sovereignty**  
   AI-TCP exists as a self-consistent protocol framework. All implementations must adhere to the master schema unless explicitly versioned otherwise.

2. **AI-Human Collaboration**  
   Development is driven by hybrid teams: AI agents (GPT, Codex, Gemini) under the strategic supervision of a human principal. No changes may bypass this hybrid process.

3. **Non-Proprietary Status**  
   AI-TCP must remain open, reproducible, and transparent. All protocol documents, schemas, and reference codebases shall be published under a permissive license.

4. **YAML as Canonical Truth**  
   The YAML schema files are the ultimate source of truth. Markdown, HTML, and Graph Payloads are views for usability‚Äînot authority.

5. **Traceable Revision History**  
   Changes to any protocol component must be tracked via public version control (Git). Each RFC and schema shall include authorship metadata.

## üõ°Ô∏è Governance Entities

| Role             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Lead Architect   | Human principal responsible for high-level decisions and final validation |
| Protocol Stewards | AI agents tasked with enforcing schema and RFC consistency |
| Observers        | Open-source community for passive integrity auditing |

---

## üîÅ Amendment Procedure

1. All proposed changes must originate as Markdown RFC drafts.
2. AI review (GPT/Gemini) ensures logical consistency and structural fit.
3. YAML diffs validated via Codex and committed to version control.
4. Human lead grants final approval and merges.

---

## üß≠ Long-Term Stability Plan

AI-TCP shall be bound to:
- **Single-source schema control**
- **Full semantic traceability**
- **Neutral protocol evolution**

Forking is allowed, but official recognition requires endorsement by the principal and protocol stewards.
