# RFC006: Protocol Trust Layer

## Overview

This RFC defines the Protocol Trust Layer for the AI-TCP communication stack. The Trust Layer provides an abstraction for managing trust, verification, and auditability across interactions between AI agents, human stakeholders, and infrastructure components.

## Purpose

To ensure that communication over AI-TCP can be trusted, verified, and auditable. This is especially critical for sensitive AI coordination scenarios involving autonomous agents.

## Components

### 1. Identity Assurance
- Use of cryptographic identity signatures (Ed25519)
- Time-limited ephemeral keys for session-bound transactions

### 2. Trust Negotiation
- Mutual challenge-response handshake before session begins
- Declaration of capability claims (optional or enforced)

### 3. Audit Logging
- All payloads include hash digests
- Deterministic transcript hashing (SHA3)
- Optional ZK-proof-backed state transitions

### 4. Authority Delegation
- Trust context may include one or more delegating agents
- Delegations can be temporary, revocable, scoped

## Message Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `trust_id` | string | Yes | Unique Trust Layer session UUID |
| `identity_proof` | object | Yes | Contains cryptographic proof of origin |
| `claim_set` | object | Optional | Capabilities or roles declared |
| `audit_hash` | string | Yes | Hash of previous communication payload |
| `delegation_token` | object | Optional | Trust delegation context |

## Integration

This layer must be supported in all AI-TCP-compliant agents participating in:
- Chain-of-Trust relay environments
- Autonomous swarms or federated LLM deployments
- Secure cooperative reasoning (multi-LLM inference)

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "trust_id": "8f3e3a57-a2bb-4ec9-9212-cda1dca821dd",
  "identity_proof": {
    "pubkey": "ABC123...",
    "sig": "XYZ789..."
  },
  "claim_set": {
    "role": "observer",
    "auth_scope": "read_only"
  },
  "audit_hash": "3a9d82f9a1f7b3a36fa...",
  "delegation_token": null
}
```

## Notes

- The Trust Layer is orthogonal to transport and payload structure.
- Future enhancements may include protocol-native attestations.
