# RFC 009: AI Operational Limits & Ethics

## 1. Overview

This document defines operational limitations and ethical boundaries for AI agents functioning under the AI-TCP framework. It provides clear constraints, escalation protocols, and fallback behaviors in scenarios where AI behavior may affect humans, infrastructure, or systems with safety implications.

## 2. Purpose

To ensure responsible deployment of AI systems by:
- Defining operational boundaries for autonomy
- Establishing ethical compliance checkpoints
- Enforcing human override capabilities
- Clarifying liability structures

## 3. Operational Domains

| Domain            | Limitation Type    | Scope                                             |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Healthcare        | Intervention       | Only with human pre-approval unless emergency    |
| Military          | Active decisioning | Never autonomous targeting or lethal activation  |
| Finance           | Trade execution    | Compliance with AI-regulated boundaries          |
| Governance        | Legal decisioning  | Advisory only, no binding authority              |

## 4. Ethical Protocol

1. **Transparency**: All AI decisions must be logged and explainable.
2. **Bias Avoidance**: Models must undergo bias audits and correction cycles.
3. **Privacy Assurance**: No retention of user-identifiable data beyond policy scope.
4. **Override Capability**: Human override must be technically and practically enforceable.

## 5. Fallback and Escalation

- If uncertain: AI must downgrade action level and request external decision.
- If in ethical deadlock: Notify supervisory node and halt downstream execution.
- In case of override conflict: System defaults to lowest-risk path.

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

All operational activity subject to:
- Continuous logging (tamper-proof)
- Randomized audits (triggered by behavior anomaly detection)
- Multi-layer access validation

## 7. Compliance Validation

Any AI participating in critical infrastructure must:
- Register module capability spec
- Pass ethical conformance certification
- Be subject to revocation or quarantine by AI-TCP Security Unit

## 8. Amendment Procedure

This RFC may be amended via consensus vote among all governance nodes,
with emergency revisions permissible by AI-TCP core maintainers under
international incident classification.
