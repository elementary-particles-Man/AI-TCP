# RFC 012: AI Packet Conflict Resolution in AI-TCP

## 1. Purpose
This RFC defines mechanisms for resolving conflicts or inconsistencies between AI-TCP packets. It aims to ensure deterministic outcomes when multiple agents modify the same context or provide contradictory information.

## 2. Common Conflict Types
- **Overwrite collisions** when two packets update the same field or resource.
- **Race conditions** resulting from near-simultaneous transmissions.
- **Divergent reasoning traces** produced by parallel LLM operations.
- **Metadata mismatches** such as conflicting timestamps or sequence numbers.

## 3. Resolution Strategies
- **Timestamp precedence**: the packet with the newest timestamp supersedes older entries.
- **LLM authority ranking**: prioritize packets according to the `llm_profile` authority level.
- **Sequence enforcement**: use incremental counters to detect out-of-order packets.
- **Trace merging**: merge compatible `reasoning_trace` steps when no direct conflicts occur.

## 4. Metadata Flags for Conflict Mediation
Include the following optional fields in the packet `meta` section:
- `conflict_detected`: boolean indicating a detected conflict.
- `resolution_strategy`: enum specifying the applied resolution method.
- `supersedes_packet`: identifier of the packet that was overridden.
- `requires_human_review`: boolean to flag human intervention.

## 5. Error Reporting & Feedback Loop Mechanisms
- Attach standardized error codes describing the conflict nature.
- Provide human-readable explanations in the response payload.
- Allow the receiving agent to request clarification or confirmation from the sender.

## 6. Status
Draft
