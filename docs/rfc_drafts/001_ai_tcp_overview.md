RFC 001: AI-TCP Protocol Overview (Revision 2)
Status: Draft
Version: 2.0
1. Abstract
This document provides the high-level conceptual and strategic overview of the AI-TCP protocol. It answers three fundamental questions: What is AI-TCP? Why is it necessary? And what core use cases does it enable? It serves as the primary entry point for any developer, researcher, or policymaker seeking to understand the project's purpose.
2. What is AI-TCP?
AI-TCP (Autonomous Intelligence Transmission Control Protocol) is a structured communication protocol designed to facilitate secure, traceable, and semantically rich interactions between independent AI agents. It functions as a universal translator and a coordination layer, enabling different LLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT, LLaMa, Grok) to share not just data, but structured intent.
3. Why is it Necessary?
As autonomous AIs proliferate, direct, unstructured interaction creates significant risks, including misinterpretation, systemic instability, and an inability to audit or assign accountability. AI-TCP addresses this by providing:
A common language to prevent semantic drift.
A traceable framework (reasoning_trace) for full auditability.
A visual state model (graph_payload) for intuitive comprehension.
A robust signaling system (signal_frame) for reliable session control.
4. Core Use Cases
Multi-Agent Collaboration: Enabling complex problem-solving by allowing specialized AIs to work in concert.
Decentralized Governance: Providing the communication backbone for governance models like the "Magi System".
Human-AI Teaming: Creating a transparent interface for human oversight and interaction with AI systems.
Secure Edge Computing: Allowing resource-constrained edge devices to participate safely in a larger intelligence network.
