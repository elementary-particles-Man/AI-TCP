RFC LSC-001: LSC: Least Sufficient Condition – Foundational Reasoning for AI-TCP Protocols
Last updated: 2025-06-25
Status: Draft
Version: 1.0

## 1. Purpose
LSC (Least Sufficient Condition) provides a universal, non-coercive reasoning framework. It allows any participant to supply temporary axioms and apply logical processes to reach conclusions without imposing ideology. This RFC summarizes how LSC acts as the conceptual foundation for AI-TCP.

## 2. Axiomatic Structure
LSC operates on a simple chain:
1. **Axiom (A)** – a verifiable starting point accepted for the current analysis.
2. **Process (B)** – a consistent, repeatable method applied to the axiom.
3. **Conclusion (C)** – a derived result whose validity is inherited from the axiom and the process.
This "A → B → C" flow reduces the need to repeatedly prove each conclusion, focusing instead on verifying the axiom and process.

## 3. Multi-Agent Cooperation
Because axioms and processes are explicit, multiple agents can share, audit, and extend each other's reasoning. LSC enables clear traceability, making it well suited for AI-TCP's packet-based thought exchange and cooperative decision making.

## 4. Application Examples
- **Packet Interpretation**: When an AI-TCP packet arrives, the receiving agent can evaluate the sender's axiom and process to reproduce or challenge the conclusion.
- **Trace Evaluation**: Reasoning traces embedded in packets follow the LSC flow, allowing observers to verify or replay each step.

## 5. Forward Compatibility
As AI-TCP evolves, LSC's minimal structure can accommodate new logic modules or extended metadata without altering its core principle. It serves as the logic core for future enhancements and cross-domain integrations.
