| Title | Created | Summary |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| [RFC 001: AI-TCP Protocol Overview](001_ai_tcp_overview.md) | 2025-06-22 | AI-TCP is a lightweight, structured protocol for inter-AI communication using YAML, Graph Payloads (Mermaid), and traceable reasoning. |
| [RFC 002: LLM Compliance Layer in AI-TCP](002_llm_compliance.md) | 2025-06-22 | This document defines the compliance requirements for Large Language Models (LLMs) participating in AI-TCP communication. |
| [RFC 003: AI-TCP Packet Structure Definition](003_packet_definition.md) | 2025-06-22 | This document formalizes the structure and minimal required fields for AI-TCP-compliant packets. These packets serve as the atomic units of communication between LLMs under the AI-TCP protocol. |
| [RFC 004: Reasoning Trace & Thought Chain Structure](004_reasoning_trace_structure.md) | 2025-06-22 | This document defines the internal structure and semantics of `reasoning_trace` used in AI-TCP packets, enabling traceability and chain-of-thought modeling among LLMs. |
