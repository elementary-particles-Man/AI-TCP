## Format & Conventions

All documents use Markdown (`.md`) for readability and YAML for embedded examples.

- Mermaid diagrams must use the `mmd:` prefix and be embedded in the `graph_payload.graph_structure` YAML field.
- Code examples should use fenced code blocks (```yaml, ```mermaid) with language tags.
- All RFC files are named as `RFC ###_topic.md` using 3-digit identifiers and snake_case.
- Each RFC must begin with `# RFC ###: Title` and use numbered section headings (`## 1.`, `## 2.` etc).

## Status

All drafts listed here are currently in **PoC-phase**, and subject to iterative updates and refinement by AI and human reviewers.

Future additions (e.g., `004_reasoning_diagnostics.md`, `005_security_considerations.md`) will follow the same structure and conventions.
