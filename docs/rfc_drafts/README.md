001_ai_tcp_overview.md
AI-TCP is a lightweight, structured protocol for inter-AI communication using YAML, Graph Payloads (Mermaid), and traceable reasoning.

002_llm_compliance.md
This document defines the compliance requirements for Large Language Models (LLMs) participating in AI-TCP communication. AI-TCP enables traceable, interpretable, and modular communication between autonomous AI agents. For such communication to succeed, participating LLMs must follow shared conventions in packet structure, field interpretation, and behavior.

003_packet_definition.md
This document formalizes the structure and minimal required fields for AI-TCP-compliant packets. These packets serve as the atomic units of communication between LLMs under the AI-TCP protocol.
