# üìë AI-TCP RFC Drafts

| Title | Created | Summary |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| [RFC Index: AI-TCP Project](000_rfc_index.md) | 2025-06-22 | This index lists all RFC drafts currently available in the `docs/rfc_drafts/` directory. |
| [RFC 001: AI-TCP Protocol Overview](001_ai_tcp_overview.md) | 2025-06-22 | AI-TCP is a lightweight, structured protocol for inter-AI communication using YAML, Graph Payloads (Mermaid), and traceable reasoning. |
| [RFC 002: LLM Compliance Layer in AI-TCP](002_llm_compliance.md) | 2025-06-22 | This document defines the compliance requirements for Large Language Models (LLMs) participating in AI-TCP communication. |
| [üì¶ **[RFCËçâÁ®ø] `003_packet_definition.md` ÊßãÈÄ†ËçâÊ°à**](003_packet_definition.md) | 2025-06-22 | ```markdown |
| [RFC 004: Reasoning Trace & Thought Chain Structure](004_reasoning_trace_structure.md) | 2025-06-22 | This document defines the internal structure and semantics of `reasoning_trace` used in AI-TCP packets, enabling traceability and chain-of-thought modeling among LLMs. |
| [RFC 005: Multi-AI Directive Protocol (MAIDP)](005_multi_ai_directive.md) | 2025-06-22 | Draft |
| [RFC006: Protocol Trust Layer](006_trust_layer_protocol.md) | 2025-06-22 | This RFC defines the Protocol Trust Layer for the AI-TCP communication stack. The Trust Layer provides an abstraction for managing trust, verification, and auditability across interactions between AI agents, human stakeholders, and infrastructure components. |
| [RFC 007: Dynamic Context Flow in AI-TCP](007_dynamic_context_flow.md) | 2025-06-22 | Dynamic Context Flow (DCF) defines a mechanism for real-time adjustment of shared memory and processing focus among collaborating AI agents in the AI-TCP protocol. This enables agents to shift priorities and maintain coherent interactions even when context changes rapidly. |
| [RFC 008: Interoperability & Extensibility](008_interop_extensibility.md) | 2025-06-22 | This RFC defines the principles and structure for ensuring interoperability between diverse LLM systems and enabling extensibility within the AI-TCP framework. It aims to foster modularity, forward-compatibility, and seamless communication in multi-agent environments. |
| [RFC 009: AI Operational Limits & Ethics](009_ai_operational_limits.md) | 2025-06-22 | This document defines operational limitations and ethical boundaries for AI agents functioning under the AI-TCP framework. It provides clear constraints, escalation protocols, and fallback behaviors in scenarios where AI behavior may affect humans, infrastructure, or systems with safety implications. |
| [RFC 014: Unified Metadata Format for AI-TCP Packets](014_metadata_format.md) | Unknown | This RFC defines a unified metadata header used in all AI-TCP packets exchanged between Large Language Models (LLMs). A consistent metadata format simplifies validation, orchestration, and auditing across diverse nodes. |
