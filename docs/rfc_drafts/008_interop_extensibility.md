# RFC 008: Interoperability & Extensibility

## 1. Introduction

This RFC defines the principles and structure for ensuring interoperability between diverse LLM systems and enabling extensibility within the AI-TCP framework. It aims to foster modularity, forward-compatibility, and seamless communication in multi-agent environments.

## 2. Definitions

- **Interoperability**: The ability of different AI systems, agents, or modules to exchange information and operate effectively together.
- **Extensibility**: The capacity of the system to be extended with new components, protocols, or behaviors without disrupting existing functionality.

## 3. Interoperability Mechanisms

### 3.1 Standardized Packet Structure

All message exchanges must conform to the AI-TCP packet format as defined in RFC 003, ensuring field consistency and mutual interpretability.

### 3.2 Payload Format Negotiation

Agents shall negotiate preferred payload formats using the handshake protocol. Supported formats include:
- JSON
- YAML
- Graph-Mermaid (prefixed with `mmd:`)
- HTML Snippets

Fallback strategies must be implemented for format mismatches.

### 3.3 Cross-Agent Vocabulary Registry

A shared vocabulary registry is recommended for concepts, task types, and role identifiers. This prevents semantic drift and ensures consistency across heterogeneous agents.

## 4. Extensibility Mechanisms

### 4.1 Modular Role and Task Structures

New roles and task types can be introduced via dedicated YAML definitions following the schema in RFC 002. All modules must implement backward-compatible interfaces.

### 4.2 Plugin Architecture

The AI-TCP runtime SHALL support runtime plugins for:
- Payload parsing
- Context switching
- Validation and sanitization

Plugins must declare compatibility metadata.

### 4.3 Schema Evolution

YAML schemas used in compliance definitions MUST support versioning. Deprecated fields shall be retained with deprecation markers for at least one major cycle.

## 5. Compatibility Policy

### 5.1 Backward Compatibility

Each release SHALL document changes that affect interoperability. LLMs and tools SHALL retain support for at least 2 prior protocol versions.

### 5.2 Forward Compatibility

Agents should be designed to ignore unknown fields and tolerate newer extensions gracefully.

## 6. Security and Integrity

Extensions must be sandboxed and signed when possible. Interoperability layers SHALL include checksums or content hash validation for exchanged payloads.

## 7. Examples

```yaml
# Example extension module
module:
  id: extension.nlp.tokenizer.v2
  type: tokenizer
  compatible_with: [ai_tcp_v1, ai_tcp_v2]
  entry_point: ./plugins/tokenizer_v2.py
```
