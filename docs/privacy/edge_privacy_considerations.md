1. Introduction
As AI-TCP facilitates communication between powerful cloud-based AIs and resource-constrained edge devices, ensuring user privacy and data security is paramount. Edge devices, such as mobile phones or IoT sensors, often handle sensitive personal or environmental data. This document outlines the key privacy threats and provides best practices for secure data handling within the AI-TCP framework on the edge.

The goal is to implement a "privacy-by-design" approach, where security is not an afterthought but a core component of the communication protocol.

2. Key Privacy Threats for Edge Devices
When edge devices transmit AI-TCP packets, they face several unique privacy risks even if the primary payload is encrypted.

Threat

Description

Example

Intent Exposure

The structure and summary of a packet, even without the full payload, can reveal sensitive information about the user's or device's intent.

A packet with intent_structure.summary: "User shows signs of acute anxiety" leaks health information even if the detailed conversation is encrypted.

Metadata Leaks

Unencrypted metadata_header fields can be aggregated to create a detailed profile of a device's behavior, location, and status.

An observer could track a device's agent_id and timestamp_utc to infer a user's daily routine or location patterns.

Replay Attacks

An attacker who captures a packet could re-transmit it to trigger a redundant or malicious action.

Replaying a packet that contains a payment authorization or a command to unlock a device.

Side-Channel Inference

The size, frequency, and timing of packets can reveal information about the underlying activity, even if the content is completely opaque.

A sudden burst of high-frequency packets from a home security sensor could indicate an event, such as a break-in.

3. Recommendations for Secure Data Handling
To mitigate these threats, the following best practices should be implemented for any edge device using AI-TCP.

3.1. Encrypt Sensitive Metadata Fields
While the full payload should always be subject to end-to-end encryption, certain fields within the metadata_header also warrant protection. We recommend encapsulating sensitive metadata within an encrypted_header block.

Recommendation: Encrypt fields like agent_id or any custom metadata that could reveal personal information. The packet_id and timestamp_utc may need to remain in plaintext for routing and replay protection, but should be handled with care. fully auditable through the reasoning_trace and the chain of signals, preventing a chaotic race condition and ensuring system stability.
