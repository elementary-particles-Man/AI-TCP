# OpenAI-API Compatibility Layer Deprecation Roadmap

This document outlines the plan for the gradual deprecation of the OpenAI-API compatibility layer in favor of the native AI-TCP protocol.

## 1. Rationale

The OpenAI-API compatibility layer was introduced to facilitate initial adoption and ease migration for existing users. However, to fully leverage the advanced features, security, and performance optimizations of the AI-TCP protocol (e.g., KAIRO integration for transparent compression, encryption, and signing, and advanced rate control), a transition to the native AI-TCP API is necessary.

## 2. Phased Deprecation Plan

We will implement a phased deprecation strategy to minimize disruption for existing users.

### Phase 1: Announcement and Documentation (Current)
- Announce the deprecation of the OpenAI-API compatibility layer.
- Provide comprehensive documentation for migrating to the native AI-TCP SDKs (Go, Python, Rust).
- Highlight the benefits of migrating to the native protocol.

### Phase 2: Feature Freeze and Warnings (Q3 2025)
- No new features will be added to the OpenAI-API compatibility layer.
- API responses will include deprecation warnings for calls made to the compatibility layer.
- Increased support and resources for migration assistance.

### Phase 3: Performance Degradation (Q1 2026)
- Introduce intentional, minor performance degradation for requests made through the compatibility layer to encourage migration.
- Continue with deprecation warnings and migration support.

### Phase 4: Removal (Q3 2026)
- The OpenAI-API compatibility layer will be fully removed from the AI-TCP API server.
- All requests to the deprecated endpoints will result in an error.

## 3. Migration Assistance Tools

To aid in the transition, the following tools will be provided:

### 3.1. SDK Migration Guides
Detailed guides for each supported SDK (Go, Python, Rust) demonstrating how to replace OpenAI-API calls with native AI-TCP SDK calls.

### 3.2. Automated Code Converters (CLI Tool)
- A command-line interface (CLI) tool that can analyze existing codebases using the OpenAI-API and suggest or automatically apply changes to use the native AI-TCP SDK.
- **Input:** Source code files (e.g., Python, Go, Rust).
- **Output:** Modified source code files or a report of suggested changes.
- **Key Features:**
    - Identification of OpenAI-API calls.
    - Mapping of OpenAI-API parameters to AI-TCP SDK parameters.
    - Automatic replacement of function calls and data structures.
    - Error handling migration.

### 3.3. Compatibility Layer Proxy (Temporary)
- A temporary proxy service that can sit between existing applications and the AI-TCP API server.
- This proxy will translate OpenAI-API requests into native AI-TCP requests, allowing applications to continue functioning without immediate code changes.
- **Purpose:** Provide a grace period for complex systems to migrate.
- **Note:** This proxy will also be deprecated and removed in Phase 4.

## 4. Communication Plan

- Regular updates via official AI-TCP communication channels (blog, newsletter, developer forums).
- Direct communication with key partners and large-scale users.
- Dedicated support channels for migration-related queries.

## 5. Feedback and Support

We encourage users to provide feedback on this roadmap and reach out for support during the transition period. Your input is valuable in ensuring a smooth migration process.
