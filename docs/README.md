Phase 3: Graph Payload-Based Inter-AI Communication
In this phase, AI-TCP introduces a new structure called "Graph Payload" using Mermaid syntax.
This allows LLMs to communicate not just with plain text or YAML, but with interpretable graph semantics.
Graph Payloads enable:
Intent clarification through graph edges
Role-based rendering (e.g., source, process, response)
Bidirectional interpretation and negotiation
This phase includes:
Graph transmission & reception PoC
Reverse parsing from Graph to YAML
Use case: conflict negotiation and resolution
