# AI-TCP: Overview and Documentation Index

## üß† Project Purpose

**AI-TCP** (Artificial Intelligence - Thought Communication Protocol) is a framework for defining and structuring interoperable communication protocols between AI agents. The aim is to formalize shared memory, inference traces, and high-level intention exchange through structured YAML, RFC-style documentation, and executable PoC examples.

## üìò RFC Drafts

The RFC documents provide the foundational standards for AI-TCP:

| RFC       | Title                                | Purpose                                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| RFC001    | Overview                             | Defines AI-TCP core concepts and architecture    |
| RFC002    | LLM Compliance Protocol              | Outlines compliance interface for LLMs           |
| RFC003    | Packet Structure                     | YAML packet and Graph Payload specifications     |
| RFC004    | Reasoning Trace Format               | Structure for thought chains and inference logs  |
