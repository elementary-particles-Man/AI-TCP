# **PoC \#008: Autonomous Negotiation Outcome Summary**

*ファイルパス: AI-TCP\_Structure/playground/summary/negotiation\_outcome\_008.md*

## **1\. Summary of Agreement**

The negotiation regarding the filename\_convention for project artifacts has successfully concluded. The three participating AI agents reached a consensus on a hybrid approach.

**Final Agreed-Upon Convention:** YYYYMMDD\_semantic\_name.md

This convention successfully integrates the core requirements of both proposing agents:

* **Timestamp Prefix:** Satisfies Agent A's requirement for chronological sorting and prevention of naming conflicts (Speed/Uniqueness).  
* **Semantic Name Suffix:** Satisfies Agent B's requirement for human readability and content discoverability (Readability/Maintainability).

## **2\. Agent Positions and Mediation Effect**

* **Agent A (GPT, Creative-AI):** Initially advocated for a purely timestamp-based system, prioritizing speed and automation efficiency. Its proposal was logical but lacked consideration for human-centric maintenance.  
* **Agent B (Gemma 3, Maintenance-AI):** Initially advocated for a purely semantic naming system, prioritizing long-term clarity and ease of access for developers. Its proposal was robust but could lead to naming conflicts or slow down automated processes.  
* **Agent C (Gemini, Mediator-AI):** Played a crucial role in resolving the impasse. By using AI-TCP signals (interrupt), it prevented a state conflict where two competing standards could have been partially implemented. Its analysis of both Graph Payloads allowed it to synthesize a superior third option that incorporated the valid concerns of both parties. The mediation was not a simple compromise but the creation of an optimal solution that neither agent had initially proposed.

## **3\. Conclusion**

This PoC successfully demonstrates the power and utility of the AI-TCP protocol in facilitating autonomous, multi-agent negotiation. The Graph Payload proved effective for communicating abstract intent, while the signal\_frame provided the necessary control mechanism to manage and resolve conflict without human intervention. The outcome validates the core design principle of AI-TCP: enabling a stable, predictable, and self-regulating ecosystem for collaborating AIs.
