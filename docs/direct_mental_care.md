# RFC-DMC-0001: Direct Mental Care Protocol

## Abstract

This document outlines the architecture, protocol design, and implementation strategy for a Direct Mental Care AI System aimed at suicide prevention and family-wide mental collapse mitigation. Built upon modern LLM infrastructure and secured via AI-TCP Protocol v1.0, the system offers real-time monitoring, emotional reasoning, and emergency interfacing.

---

## 1. Motivation

Suicide and familial mental collapse have become critical social issues in the modern world. This RFC proposes a system leveraging AI reasoning and sentiment scoring (PHQ-9, GAD-7) to provide direct, context-sensitive mental health interventions, accessible via common devices.
