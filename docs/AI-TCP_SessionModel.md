# AI-TCP Session Model

This document outlines the design principles and mechanisms for session management and resumption within the AI-TCP protocol.

## 1. Session Establishment

AI-TCP sessions are established through a secure handshake process, leveraging ephemeral key exchange to ensure forward secrecy and prevent replay attacks. The `EphemeralSession` FlatBuffers schema (`KAIRO/schema/ephemeral_session.fbs`) defines the core structure for managing these temporary session states.

### Key Principles:

*   **Ephemeral Keys**: Each session utilizes unique, short-lived cryptographic keys to enhance security.
*   **Mutual Authentication**: Both parties in a communication establish trust through cryptographic means.
*   **Session Identifiers**: Unique identifiers are used to track and manage active sessions.

## 2. Session State Management

Session state includes cryptographic parameters (e.g., shared secrets, nonces), sequence numbers, and other context necessary for ongoing communication. This state must be securely managed and synchronized between communicating nodes.

### Components Involved:

*   `ephemeral_session_manager.rs`: Manages the lifecycle of ephemeral sessions.
*   `session_resumption.rs`: Handles the logic for resuming interrupted sessions.
*   `ephemeral_resumption.rs`: Specifically addresses the resumption of ephemeral sessions.

## 3. Session Resumption

AI-TCP supports session resumption to minimize overhead and latency for subsequent communications between the same parties. This involves securely re-establishing a communication channel using previously negotiated session parameters or a derived shared secret.

### Resumption Mechanisms:

*   **Ticket-based Resumption**: (To be detailed) A mechanism where a session ticket is issued and can be presented for faster re-establishment.
*   **Key Derivation**: (To be detailed) Re-deriving session keys from a master secret without a full handshake.

## 4. Security Considerations for Sessions

*   **Replay Attack Mitigation**: Mechanisms like unique nonces and sequence numbers are crucial to prevent replay attacks during session establishment and data exchange.
*   **Session Hijacking Prevention**: Strong authentication and integrity checks are vital to prevent unauthorized parties from taking over an established session.
*   **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of session keys enhances long-term security.

## 5. Future Enhancements

*   Detailed specification of session ticket format and exchange protocol.
*   Integration with external key management systems.
*   Support for multi-party sessions.
