PoC #5 Report: AI Packet Conflict Resolution
Last Updated: 2025-06-25
Status: Completed
Related RFCs: RFC 012, RFC 016

1. Scenario Overview
This Proof-of-Concept simulates a common conflict scenario in a multi-agent system: two AI agents attempt to modify the state of a shared resource simultaneously.

Agent-A attempts to set the status of resource-_alpha_ to "active".

Agent-B attempts to set the status of the same resource to "maintenance".

A neutral third-party agent, Moderator-01 (simulating a Gemini-powered observer), detects the conflict and uses the signal_frame to manage and resolve it according to predefined rules.

The objective is to demonstrate how AI-TCP's signaling mechanism can prevent data corruption and ensure a deterministic, auditable outcome.

2. Conflicting Packet Traces (YAML)
The following two packets are dispatched at nearly the same time, creating a race condition.

Packet A: Request to set status to "active"
id: "pkt-a-7781"
agent_id: "Agent-A"
timestamp_utc: "2025-06-25T15:00:00.100Z"
intent_structure:
  summary: "Set resource-alpha status to active."
  reasoning_trace:
    - step: 1
      input: "Request from upstream service to activate resource-alpha."
      output: "Dispatching packet to set status to 'active'."


Packet B: Request to set status to "maintenance"
id: "pkt-b-9902"
agent_id: "Agent-B"
timestamp_utc: "2025-06-25T15:00:00.150Z"
intent_structure:
  summary: "Set resource-alpha status to maintenance for scheduled diagnostics."
  reasoning_trace:
    - step: 1
      input: "Scheduled maintenance window for resource-alpha has opened."
      output: "Dispatching packet to set status to 'maintenance'."


3. Resolution Flow using signal_frame
Moderator-01 observes both packets and initiates the resolution flow using RFC 016 signals.

Step 1: Interrupt Signal
The moderator immediately sends an interrupt signal to both agents to prevent them from proceeding.

# Packet sent to both Agent-A and Agent-B
signal_frame:
  signal_id: "sig-int-1123"
  signal_type: "interrupt"
  # This links to the specific packet being halted
  linked_packet_id: "pkt-a-7781" # (or "pkt-b-9902" for the other message)
  confirmed: true # Requires an 'ack' from the agents
  issued_by: "Moderator-01"
  timestamp_utc: "2025-06-25T15:00:00.200Z"
  reason_code: "STATE_CONFLICT_DETECTED"
  notes: "Conflicting write operations detected for resource-alpha. Halting execution pending resolution."


Step 2: Resolution Packet
After receiving ack signals from both agents, the moderator's internal logic (simulating Gemini) makes a decision and broadcasts the final, resolved state.

# Packet broadcast to all relevant agents
id: "pkt-res-4567"
agent_id: "Moderator-01"
timestamp_utc: "2025-06-25T15:00:00.500Z"
intent_structure:
  summary: "Conflict for resource-alpha resolved. Final status is 'maintenance'."
  reasoning_trace:
    - step: 1
      input: "Received conflicting packets pkt-a-7781 and pkt-b-9902."
      output: "Applied resolution policy: 'maintenance' intent supersedes 'active' intent for safety reasons."
    - step: 2
      input: "Resolution decided."
      output: "Broadcasting final state and sending resolution signals."

# The same packet contains signals to close the loops with the original agents
signal_frames: # A packet can contain multiple signals
  - signal_id: "sig-ack-b-9902"
    signal_type: "ack"
    linked_packet_id: "pkt-b-9902"
    confirmed: false
    issued_by: "Moderator-01"
    timestamp_utc: "2025-06-25T15:00:00.500Z"
    notes: "Your request was processed and accepted."
  - signal_id: "sig-fail-a-7781"
    signal_type: "fail"
    linked_packet_id: "pkt-a-7781"
    confirmed: false
    issued_by: "Moderator-01"
    timestamp_utc: "2025-06-25T15:00:00.500Z"
    reason_code: "SUPERSEDED_BY_PRIORITY_ACTION"
    notes: "Your request was denied due to a higher-priority maintenance action."


4. Gemini's Decision Logic
The moderator agent, powered by Gemini, would parse the two conflicting packets and apply a predefined resolution policy. The logic would be as follows:

Identify Conflict: Recognize that both pkt-a-7781 and pkt-b-9902 target the same resource (resource-alpha) and the same field (status).

Apply Policy: Access the operational rulebook for resource-alpha. The rulebook states: "For safety and system integrity, any maintenance request automatically has higher priority than an active request, regardless of timestamp."

Formulate Resolution:

Accept the intent from pkt-b-9902.

Reject the intent from pkt-a-7781.

Construct a resolution packet that communicates the final state and notifies both original agents of the outcome via their respective signal_frame responses.

5. Final State & Summary
Final State: The status of resource-alpha is successfully set to "maintenance".

Summary: This PoC successfully demonstrates that the AI-TCP signal_frame provides the necessary mechanism for a moderating AI to detect, halt, and deterministically resolve conflicts between agents. The process is fully auditable through the reasoning_trace and the chain of signals, preventing a chaotic race condition and ensuring system stability.
