PoC #3: Reverse Reception Test Summary
Objective: To test if a receiving AI can accurately reconstruct the original structured YAML intent from a Mermaid graph and a natural language narrative.
Result: SUCCESS.
Analysis: The test confirmed that the combination of visual structure (Mermaid) and contextual explanation (Narrative) provides sufficient semantic information for a high-fidelity reconstruction of the source intent_packet. This demonstrates the protocol's effectiveness in transmitting abstract meaning, a cornerstone of true AI interoperability.
