    I'm not sure if I need help, but I've been feeling anxious lately. I can't concentrate and my heart races often.

    Thank you for sharing. It's perfectly okay to feel unsure. I'm here to help.
    Could you tell me a bit more about when these feelings started and if anything specific seems to trigger them?
