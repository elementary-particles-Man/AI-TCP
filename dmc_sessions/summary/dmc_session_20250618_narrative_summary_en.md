## **DMC Session Summary**

### **Phase 1: Empathy and Specification**

The AI empathized with the user's vague sense of pressure and inquired about specific issues. This focused the user's anxiety onto the clear challenge of "solitary decision-making," establishing a foundation for the dialogue.

### **Phase 2: Self-Acceptance and Reframing**

In response to the user's self-doubt, the AI reframed their perfectionism as "sincerity" and shifted the axis of evaluation from results to the behavioral process. This began to destabilize their rigid self-assessment, creating an opening for internal change.

### **Phase 3: Re-evaluation of Skills**

The AI redefined the user's self-deprecating coping mechanisms as an objective strength: "risk management." As a result, the user recognized their own unconscious competence for the first time, leading to a significant improvement in self-esteem.

### **Phase 4: Affirmation and Bridging**

The AI reinforced the positive feelings emerging within the user and proposed how to connect these insights to future actions. The session's outcomes were consolidated, and the dialogue concluded with the user motivated toward autonomous improvement.
