- chapter: 'Block A: The U.S. Strategic Shift and Domestic Ideology'
  summary: 'The "institutional risk" of U.S. policy changing unpredictably is becoming apparent. The existence of "Project 2025," designed to neutralize resistance to radical policy proposals, suggests a potential overhaul of the traditional power balance.'
  sections:
    - title: 'A.1. Proposed Reorganization of Foreign Policy and Budgets'
      narrative: 'Radical proposals, such as a 75% cut in foreign aid and defunding the UN/NATO, have emerged from circles around the Trump administration. While congressional resistance is expected, these proposals signal a strong intent to abandon America''s traditional international role, creating profound uncertainty for allies. The political "disruption" itself is a geopolitical risk, more so than the feasibility of the policies.'
    - title: 'A.2. The "Project 2025" Framework and Conservative Institutional Design'
      narrative: '"Project 2025" is not merely a collection of policies. It is a well-prepared execution plan to "dismantle the administrative state" by concentrating power in the presidency and replacing the federal bureaucracy with politically loyal personnel. This is a structural threat that could alter the U.S. policymaking process itself and hollow out the system of checks and balances.'
    - title: 'A.3. The "Anti-Fiat" Ideological Vector'
      narrative: 'The "Anti-Fiat" ideology is translating into concrete political action, such as the introduction of the "Gold Reserve Transparency Act." This represents an ideological challenge to the existing financial system, including the Federal Reserve, fueled by distrust over national debt and inflation. While not mainstream, it has emerged as a new risk factor for the stability of U.S. monetary policy.'

- chapter: 'Block B: Tri-Polar Geopolitical Instability'
  summary: 'Security crises that could trigger chain reactions are progressing simultaneously in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. A highly fragile global security environment has formed, carrying the risk of a "domino effect" where a single point of failure could cascade through the entire system.'
  sections:
    - title: 'B.1. The Israel-Hezbollah Front'
      narrative: 'The Israel-Hezbollah conflict is in a state of "managed conflict," subordinate to the broader conflict with Iran. It remains contained to skirmishes as neither side desires a full-scale war, but this equilibrium is extremely fragile. Notably, U.S. moves concerning the UNIFIL mandate are becoming a new flashpoint that could destabilize the region.'
    - title: 'B.2. Pakistan''s Compound Crisis'
      narrative: 'Pakistan is simultaneously exposed to two pressures: strict IMF-imposed austerity and military tensions with India. This is a textbook example of a "compound crisis" where economic collapse and military conflict risks are interlinked. The instability of this nuclear-armed state is a grave concern that could fundamentally shake regional security.'
    - title: 'B.3. NATO''s Internal Cohesion and Strategic Alignment'
      narrative: 'NATO adopted a new "5% of GDP for defense" target, projecting unity in response to U.S. demands. However, Spains public opposition and differing stances on Ukraine and China strategy reveal serious cracks in the alliance. The transactional U.S. foreign policy risks putting NATO on a "two-track" path, eroding its capacity for unified action in a crisis.'

- chapter: 'Block C: AI-driven Socio-Economic Transformation'
  summary: 'The "asynchronicity" between the speed of AI-driven job displacement and the slow pace of government policy response is creating new sources of social unrest. The widening wealth gap caused by this technological shift is at a dangerous stage, poised to amplify political distrust.'
  sections:
    - title: 'C.1. Job Displacement Attributed to AI'
      narrative: 'Major corporations like Intel, IBM, and Amazon have officially announced and are executing tens of thousands of layoffs, citing efficiency gains from AI. White-collar and administrative roles are particularly affected, making it clear that AI-driven labor replacement has moved from speculation to an accelerating economic reality.'
    - title: 'C.2. Government Safety Nets and Workforce Adaptation Initiatives'
      narrative: 'The response from G7 governments has not progressed to establishing fundamental safety nets like UBI, remaining at the preparatory stage of "formulating action plans" and "supporting reskilling." The government response is severely lagging behind rapid corporate layoffs, revealing a total lack of preparedness for the social impact of technological innovation.'
    - title: 'C.3. Macroeconomic Impact Analysis'
      narrative: 'Analyses from the IMF and PwC suggest that while AI boosts productivity, it is likely to "significantly widen" wealth inequality by accelerating the income shift from labor to capital. As wages for AI-skilled workers soar, a large number of displaced workers will be created. This economic polarization will decisively fragment society.'
