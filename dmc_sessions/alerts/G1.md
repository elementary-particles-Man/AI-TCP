Block A: The U.S. Strategic Shift
Key Point:
Radical isolationist policy proposals are emerging within the U.S., clashing with existing institutional resistance. However, the existence of "Project 2025," a meticulous plan designed to neutralize this resistance (the bureaucracy) and maximize presidential power, suggests a potential fundamental shift in the traditional balance of power.

Current Situation & Problem Statement:
Currently, the feasibility of these radical proposals is low, but they function as political leverage, creating uncertainty for allies. The core issue is the "institutional risk" that U.S. policy could abruptly change via top-down decisions, bypassing traditional checks and balances like Congress. We are forced to construct new security and economic policy frameworks that assume an era of unpredictable U.S. commitments.

Block B: Tri-Polar Geopolitical Instability
Key Point:
Security crises that could trigger chain reactions are "simultaneously progressing" in three key poles: the Middle East (Israel-Hezbollah), South Asia (Pakistan), and Europe (NATO). These events are not independent; they form a complex risk structure where a single spark could ignite instability in other regions.

Current Situation & Problem Statement:
Israel continues a "managed conflict," Pakistan is in a tightrope situation where IMF support is its lifeline, and NATO projects unity at the behest of the U.S. while nursing internal fractures. This fragile equilibrium carries the risk of a domino effect, where a failure at one point could cascade through the entire system. We are required to make the strategic judgment of where to concentrate our diplomatic resources by identifying which node's stabilization would be most effective against this global chain of instability.

Block C: AI-driven Socio-Economic Transformation
Key Point:
The "speed" of job displacement caused by AI is far outpacing the "speed" of government safety net construction. This "tech-policy asynchronicity" is creating new fault lines within developed nations and is becoming a serious source of social unrest.

Current Situation & Problem Statement:
Corporations are already executing large-scale layoffs driven by AI adoption, while institutions like the IMF and PwC warn that wealth inequality will expand sharply. Meanwhile, the response from G7 nations remains at the preparatory stage of "formulating action plans." If this gap is left unaddressed, a rise in political distrust and populism is inevitable. We are in a critical situation where we must urgently design and implement "buffers" to maintain social stability.
